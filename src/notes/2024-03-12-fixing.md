# **How to Fix Mistakes in Relationships**

I just watched a super TED talk about how important it is to fix our mistakes in relationships, especially between parents and kids, but really, this goes for any important relationship. It got me thinking a lot about how to make things better after a mess-up.

Here's what I learned and some tips I want to remember from the [Becky Kennedy's TED talk 'The single most important parenting strategy'](https://www.ted.com/talks/becky_kennedy_the_single_most_important_parenting_strategy/):

## **Things to Remember:**

- Fixing is for Everyone:
   Every close relationship has tough times. It's all about how we fix those moments.
- Saying Sorry is Just the Start:
   Making things right is more than just saying, "I'm sorry." It's about really connecting again and understanding what went wrong.
- Mistakes are Chances to Grow:
   It's okay to mess up. What counts is using those mess-ups as chances to get even better at making things right.
- Fixing Now Helps in the Long Run:
   If we don't fix things, it can leave the other person feeling really down about themselves, even later in life.

## **Steps to Make Things Right:**

### 1. First, Make Things Right with Yourself:

- It's Okay to Feel Upset: Accept how you feel, but know those feelings don't define you.
- You Are Not Your Mistake:Remember, one bad moment doesn't say who you are.

### 2. Next, Go and Make Things Right with Them:

- Say What Went Wrong: Be clear about the issue without blaming them.
- Own Up: Admit your part honestly.
- Talk About Next Time: Share your plan to handle things better if this happens again.

### 3. What Not to Do:

- Don't blame them: "I yelled because you started it."
- No excuses: "You should be thankful, then you wouldn't be yelled at."

### 4. Teach Better Ways:

- Use this chance to teach how to talk about dislikes with kindness, like, "This isn't my favorite."

## **Why Sharing This Matters**

Talking about fixing mistakes shows everyone it's possible to bounce back stronger and more connected. It's a skill that brings us closer and builds understanding.

**Always Remember, It's Never Too Late**A big takeaway is it's never too late to fix things, no matter how old the mistake. Trying to fix it can really make a difference to someone, showing it's possible to move past hurts and connect deeper.

In simple terms, learning to fix our mistakes isn't just about undoing a wrong; it's about strengthening our bonds with those we care about. Let's get better at making things right, showing we understand, care, and are willing to grow from our mess-ups.

Remember, every mistake is a chance to connect and grow. Let’s not shy away from fixing things, because it’s how we show we really care. Let’s make our relationships stronger one fix at a time.
