# Improve your mileage by ~3.3 percent and reduce CO2 emissions

Hi,
1. I am reading the book [The Carbon Almanac](https://thecarbonalmanac.org) by Seth Godin and J. Thorn.
2. The book collects facts about the climate catastrophe.
3. What's more, it gives the real and commonly accessable actions one can take to make the difference, instead of falling into catastrophism and apathy.

# What and how?
I will share an action that I found in [The Daily Difference](https://thecarbonalmanac.org/the-daily-difference/) newsletter 
1. One of the changes that you can make on your own and "on the spot" is taking care of the correct car tires' pressure.
2. It turns out that over 80% of cars in the US market have lower than recommended tire pressure.
3. According to the research, correctly inflated tires in a car can improve the mileage by around 3.3 percent.

# How does it look like in my case?
In my case, it looks like this:

1. My car has a 45 liter fuel tank.
2. It consumes on average 5.5 liters of gasoline per 100 km
3. I can drive on average about 800 km on one tank (I drive less because I usually refuel when the fuel level does not drop to 0);
4. A saving of 3.3% of 800 km is 26.4 km, which is about 3.3 km per 100 km.
5. With my annual distance of 12,000 km, this is an additional 396 km, which is half a fuel tank for free, i.e. PLN 136.40 in my pocket.

When it comes to CO2 emissions, I count it as follows:

1. According to the manufacturer, my car produces 81 grams of CO2 per kilometer.
2. As I mentioned before, I can drive 3.3% more on one fuel tank.
3. It means, the 800 km distance generates 64.8 kilograms of CO2...
4. ...but because of the correctly inflated tires, I drive 826.4 km and generate the same number of kilograms of CO2, but per kilometer driven, less CO2 in the atmosphere will come out.

# How to do it?
1. Check the tire pressure at least once a month.
2. The optimum tire pressure usually can be found in the owner's manual, or inside the driver-side door.
3. Tire pressure is best checked when the tire is cold, because a warm tire has a warm air inside that expands and therefore shows a higher pressure.
