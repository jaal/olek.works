# What purchase <$100 has made you more productive?
Recently I came across a great question, which made me thinking. Here's my list.

## Carafe (~ $5)
Let's start with something simple.

In the past, I noticed I hadn’t been drinking enough water. I tried many things. Flasks, even bigger flasks, apps, etc. What helped me, were

* a basic IKEA carafe
* a basic IKEA glass

I don’t know what’s the magic behind that, but it does the trick. Being better hydrated gives me higher energy level and I feel better.

The carafe cost me ~ $5.

I elaborated [about this topic here](../carafe/).

## Endel / Brain.fm subscription (~ $20)
I love these apps. They help me focus, relax, meditate, etc. I’ve been using them for four and eight years, respectively.

Endel costs me ~$20 a year. Brain.fm cost me ~$39 for a lifetime subscribtion.

## Zen Radio (~ $0)
Additonally, I also use Zen Radio. They offer the premium for ~$40 a year. They are so generous with their free plan, it's perfectly fine to use it in the free plan.

## Insight Timer (~ $60)
I'm not the first person to praise meditation apps. I've tried the most popular ones and Insight Timer suits me best.

## Klack (~ $4)
I discovered I like the sound of typing while writing. It doesn’t have to be the loud sound of a typewriter. The gentle sound of mechanical keyboard is sufficient.

Klack offers that sound for 4 bucks instead of 20–100 bucks for the real mechanical keyboard. And you don’t have to have an additional keyboard.
