# A simple web app that gives you Stoic philosophy advice using AI

## What This Is

A simple web app that gives you Stoic philosophy advice using AI. I built it with Claude (no coding needed!), proving that anyone can create cool stuff even without programming skills.

## How It All Started

### August 18 - The Birthday Idea

**What happened:** Got the idea on my birthday morning while reading

- Had this thought: "What if I made an app to help people see things from a Stoic perspective?"
- Started asking for feedback and looking into how to build it
- Found out about Claude's no-code features

**What I did:**

- Created the basic idea
- Started a feedback thread
- Began building the first version

**Problems I faced:**

- Had no idea how to build an app without coding
- Needed to figure out which tools to use

### August 19 - First Version is Live!

**What happened:** Actually finished and launched my first working app

- Built it completely using Claude - super easy and fast!
- Felt really proud that I could build something real
- Link: https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/f9d6a01a-f6bf-4169-863b-e37c5fe4fe10

**What I did:**

- Made a working app that actually gives Stoic advice
- Proved to myself I can build things

**Next things to do:**

1. Make the AI responses better (tone, content, how it looks)
2. Add privacy info so people know I can't see their questions
3. Make it work better on phones

### August 20 - Making Responses Better

**What happened:** Spent the day improving how the AI responds

- Learned better ways to talk to AI from community tips

**What I did:**

- Worked on making the AI give better, more helpful answers
- Used better prompting techniques

**Problems I faced:**

- Still struggling with some work problems

### August 21 - Making It Look Better

**What happened:** Kept working on it and felt more confident about AI

- Changed my attitude from worried to excited about using AI

**What I did:**

- Changed the design to simple black and white
- Added privacy information
- Made it look cleaner overall

**Problems I faced:**

- Trying to keep it simple but still useful
- Making sure people understand their privacy

### August 23 - Latest Updates

**What happened:**

- Got a stable web address that doesn't keep changing
- Made the app smarter about handling weird questions

**What I did:**

1. **Better responses:** Made the AI sound less robotic (still working on this)
2. **Handles nonsense:** If someone types gibberish, the AI asks them to clarify
3. **Self-reflection questions:** Added questions at the end to help people think deeper
4. **Stable link:** Now it's at https://olekwrites.com/ask-stoic and won't keep changing

**Problems I faced:**

- Every time I updated the app, the link would change (super annoying!)
- Still trying to make the AI responses sound more natural
- Balancing helpful automation with real human connection

## How I Built It

- Used Claude AI with no coding required
- Proved that you don't need to be a programmer to build useful apps
- Got help and feedback from the Purple Space community

## What's Next

People suggested I could:

- Improve the quality of the answers
- Train it on specific Stoic books and texts
- Make it work with social media platforms
- Compare ancient vs modern Stoic ideas
- Make it work even better on phones

## The Big Lesson

You don't need to know how to code to build something meaningful. With the right tools and a supportive community, anyone can create apps that actually help people!
