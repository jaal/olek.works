# What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid?

Once upon a time, I walked down an alley and there was a litter bin. Gray, dirty, ugly, and a bit dented. Nothing to see there.

But it was a special bin.

It had a label on it that said: **"What would you do, if you weren't afraid?"**

It caught my attention. I'd never heard that before.

## The Ultimate Stopper

What a powerful question.

I started wondering. Indeed, fear is the ultimate stopper for me. What if I did a thought experiment where I eliminated that factor? What if I could do everything, knowing there wouldn't be any fear?

Excellent question.

## When to Use It

Once in a while, I ask myself this question, especially when I get stuck.

Not every day. Not as a mantra. Just when I notice resistance. When I'm avoiding something. When I'm making excuses. When I know what I should do but can't seem to start.

That's when this question cuts through everything else.

## Try It Yourself

Ask yourself this question. See where it will get you.

You might be surprised by what comes up. Not because the answer is revolutionary, but because you already knew it. You just needed permission to admit it.

**PS:** Here was my answer back then. If I weren't afraid, I would open a pizza food truck for surfers on Canary Island.

**What's yours?**
