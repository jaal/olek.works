# Match My Donation or Stop Taking Credit

Here's the issue. I've been thinking a lot about charity donations at checkout. You know the moment - you pay with a credit card, and a prompt appears: "Would you like to donate to a noble cause with $X?" Then this company brags about how much they support charitable causes. But who's really doing the donating? Them or me?

I'd love to help. But if they want to piggyback on my donation and take credit for it, here's a fair deal: they should at least match my contribution. Better yet, double it. Wouldn't that be fair?
