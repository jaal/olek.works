# Would you allow a stranger to have an hour of my time for $0.83?
Netflix introduced a new plan - Basic with ads for $6.99/month - next to the current Basic for $9.99.month. They claimed to show about 4-5 minutes of ads for each hour of content watched.

Let's say:
1. I watch Netflix **one hour a day**, every day. 
1. In a month I would watch around 150 mintutes of ads (30 days x 5 minutes per day of ads).
1. This means that Netflix value my time **3$ / 2.5 hours = $0.83/hour**. 
1. What's even worse, when I choose this plan, this means I value my time as little as $0.83/hour

In contrary, would I allow someone to have an hour of time for $0.83?

I try to have my time as much ad-free as possible. I don't watch traditional TV and listen to traditional radio stations, because of the ads. I try to enter movie theather as late as possible to avoid watching ads. I have several different ad blockers installed in my browsers.

Despite these actions, I still have a feeling that my attention is being chopped in to small pieces and robbed one by one. 

I still watch large billboards next to the roads, or small billboards on the bus stops. When I enter the mall, I'm surrounded by countless ads.

PS The numbers get even worse in case I watch more than one hour a day.

Would love to hear your take, Olek
