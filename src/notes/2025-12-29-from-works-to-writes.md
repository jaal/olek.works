# When Domain Renewal Costs 9x More Than Registration

I changed my domain from olek.works to olekwrites.com. Here's why.

When I first registered olek.works, I loved it. The name perfectly reflected my purpose - sharing my work with the world. Through Namecheap, it cost me just $4.16. A steal, right?

## The Expensive Surprise

What I didn't account for was the renewal price.

A year later, I got the bill: **$37.18 for renewal**. That's nearly 9 times the registration cost. For a personal blog, that's steep. I was paying premium prices for a domain extension that seemed like a bargain upfront.

This is the trap with specialty domain extensions. The initial registration is cheap to get you hooked, but the renewal fees reveal the true cost.

## The Search for Something Better

I needed a domain that was:
- Reasonably priced upfront
- Affordable to renew year after year
- Still meaningful

Through Cloudflare, I found it. I registered **olekwrites.com** for about $10, with renewals costing roughly the same amount. That's a 70% cost reduction compared to renewing the .works domain.

## Why olekwrites.com Works

The new domain has its own charm. "Olek writes" feels more personal and authentic than "Olek works." It's what I actually do here - I write. About tech, side projects, ideas, and lessons learned. The .com extension is classic, trusted, and most importantly, sustainably priced.

## The Lesson

Before registering a domain, always check the renewal cost. That promotional first-year price might look tempting, but it's the renewal fee that determines whether you can actually afford to keep it long-term.

Sometimes the most expensive lesson teaches you the cheapest solution.
