# Carafe
## *The short story how I moved away from drinking not enough water in one simple step.*
While working, I used to have a flask on my desk and drank directly from it.

* I usually finished my day with one or two refills. That equaled to 450-900 ml (~ 15-30 fl oz).
* Together with other water intakes, it didn’t sum up to the bare minimum.

I knew I should have drunk more. My doctor told me so. What’s more, the common knowledge proves the good hydration is a key.

The easiest way was to keep hydrating at my desk while working, since I had easy access to drinkable running water.

I did some experiments.

1. I used hydration apps. They didn’t help. I just skipped the reminder.
2. I used bigger flasks, so I wouldn’t have had to go to the kitchen so often.
3. I used numerous types of bidons.
4. And I failed. I still had a problem with regular water intakes.

The solution occurred to be simple.

By chance, I used a carafe. In our home, the carafe usually stayed deep in the cupboard. Nobody wants to use it on the daily basis. We reserved it when we needed an additional, nice looking water container. You know, for guests only.

I gave it a try.

The carafe in the company of the glass did the trick. I started drinking more. Two or three carafes of water a day. This equals to 2-3 liters (~ 67-100 fl oz).

I wondered why it happened like that. Does it really matter how the water is wrapped? I guess it does. I don’t know the exact reason for that and simply enjoy the fact that it works.

PS, This is the carafe that did the trick. It's a simple, slim, 1 liter volume carafe from IKEA.

PS', Not to mention the fact it's eco-friendly. I have been using the same water container for some time, refilling it with tap water.
