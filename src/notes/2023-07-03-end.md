# "The end of the world" approach
The book ["It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work"](https://basecamp.com/books/calm) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson is the collection of essays and ideas about work culture and ethics, which come from their experience running Basecamp / 37signals.

One of my favorite essays is *"No Big Deal or the End of the World?"* (available for free on [Jason Fried's blog](https://world.hey.com/jason/no-big-deal-or-the-end-of-the-world-0b0d8619)). It brings the story of Jean-Louis Gass√©e, the former executive from Apple. When dealing with people who have trouble, there are two approaches you can take:

1. *"It's not a big deal"*
2. *"It's the end of the world"*

Whichever approach you take, they will choose the other.

## Here's an example from my life.
1. At work, I made a mistake. I didn't notice it, so I didn't have a chance to fix it. My boss let me know about it. It sounded serious. I mean, I read the message on Slack in my head with 
[the voice of Brain Cox performing Logan Roy from Succession](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRN03cExSOY).
. It couldn't have sounded any less serious.
2. From my perspective, it wasn't the kind of "the end of the world" error. Just a minor mistake. I could have had an attitude, "it's not a big deal". That was my primary thought. 
3. Fortunately, I didn't follow that path and [didn't listen to my lizard brain, which prompted *"fight or flight"* solution](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/where-addiction-meets-your-brain/201404/your-lizard-brain).
4. I took a token, "it's the end of the world". I acknowledged the fact, treated it as serious as my boss had done, and offered a set of possible solutions. It turned out, it indeed hadn't been that serious and that urgent, as my boss later confirmed.

## Why does it work for me?
1. It may sound like I want to outplay someone with this approach, by not being sincere. No, it's not a cunning way to trick someone and win the argument. 
2. It's about showing understanding, respect, and empathy to a person. That's inline with me and my approach.
3. Beside the fact it's coherent with my values and I feel good, when going that direction, it's also effective. It brings calm, and when the feelings and emotions are on the steady level. Definitely, it's easier to communicate that way.
