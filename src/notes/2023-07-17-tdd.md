# Let's make together something meaningful today

There are couple of newsletters I wait for them to land in my Inbox and read them from A to Z.

The Carbon Almanac's ['The Daily Difference'](https://thecarbonalmanac.org/the-daily-difference/) is one of them. This newsletter is built by the community of volunteers who want to make a difference. From around the world they create it with the main goal "to help taking action and making a significant positive impact".  

It comes daily and it's superpacked with the knowledge, when you want to make a dent in the universe.

I recommend you to try. The worst thing that can happen, you don't act on it and you unsubscribe. The best thing, you could actually do something meaningful. [Let's make something meaningful today and sign up!](https://thecarbonalmanac.org/the-daily-difference/)
