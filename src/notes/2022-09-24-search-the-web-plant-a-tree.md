Hey!

1.  In 2019 switching the search engine from Google to [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) took me less than 30 seconds.

2.  Switching the mind and getting used to it took me a couple of days.

3.  Ever since then, I have searched over 22 000 times, which means I could be part of planting over 480 trees.
