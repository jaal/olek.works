# One Page That Shows My Current Priorities

I have a [/now page](/now) on this blog. It's a simple idea that more people should know about.

The idea is simple: a single page that answers the question "What are you focused on right now?" Not what you did in the past. Not your entire life story. Just what's consuming your time and attention at this moment.

## Where This Came From

The concept was created by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now) in 2015. He wanted a way to tell people what he was currently working on without having to repeat himself in emails and conversations.

The idea caught on. Today, thousands of websites have /now pages. There's even a directory at [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com) where people share theirs.

## Why It's Different From an About Page

An about page is static. It tells your story, your background, your general interests. It rarely changes.

A now page is dynamic. It changes as your priorities shift. Mine has been updated dozens of times since I created it.

When I look at someone's website, I check their /now page before their about page. The about page tells me who they were. The now page tells me who they are.

## What Goes On a Now Page

Derek Sivers suggests three simple questions:
- What are you focused on?
- Where are you?
- What are you reading?

That's it. No need to overthink it.

My /now page includes:
- Where I'm based (Wrocław, Poland)
- What I'm working on (my job, side projects, current interests)
- What I'm reading (with strikethroughs for finished books)

It's not polished. It's not comprehensive. It's honest.

## The Real Value: Accountability

Here's what I didn't expect: maintaining a /now page keeps me honest with myself.

When I update it, I'm forced to confront what's actually consuming my time versus what I *wish* was consuming my time. If something has been on my now page for months without progress, that's a signal.

It's like a public commitment device. When I write "I'm working on X," I have to ask myself: am I really? Or is that just something I tell myself I'm doing?

## How to Create Your Own

1. Create a page at yourdomain.com/now
2. Answer: What are you focused on right now?
3. Update it whenever your priorities change (monthly is a good rhythm)
4. That's it.

No fancy design needed. No perfect prose required. Just clarity about what matters to you today.

If you want to join the movement, add your now page to the directory at [nownownow.com/submit](https://nownownow.com/submit).

## Start With This Question

If someone asks "What are you up to these days?" and you had to answer in under 100 words, what would you say?

That's your now page.

The rest is just keeping it updated.
