# I Wanted to Write, Not Publish

What I wanted in the beginning was to have an independent, cheap, and reliable platform to publish my words. I found Github Pages + a nice template. It worked as I desired.

I could have focused on writing... Well, it turned out, I couldn't have done.

## The Publishing Problem

What didn't work well was the process of publishing.

With a git repository, I wasn't only responsible for writing. It wasn't just a one-click solution.

I had to copy-paste the last .md file, then fill in all the details, then create the image, then create the branch, then commit, then deploy, etc. Most of my time, I didn't spend on writing.

## The Simple Solution

Thanks to Claude Code and Terminal, I could focus once again on writing. The solution was simple: I created an instruction template for Claude Code. Once I finish writing, I copy-paste the text, and ask Claude Code to do its work.

The automation handles:
- Creating the blog post file with proper frontmatter
- Suggesting slug, title, tags, and SEO optimization
- Generating ChatGPT prompts for pixel art images
- Following the established structure and style

## Here's the Template

You can download the template here: [.n.md](/assets/blog/.n.md)

Now when I want to publish, I just run one command and paste my text. Claude Code takes care of the rest - the file structure, the metadata, the formatting. I'm back to doing what I wanted to do in the first place: writing.

Sometimes the best productivity hack isn't working harder. It's automating the parts that don't need your creativity.

Happy writing!
