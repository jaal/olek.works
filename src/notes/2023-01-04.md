![A person falling down](/images/2023-01-04.png)

Hey,

I've been reading '[Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com)' by Kim Scott. It's a book about the management philosophy, where the key is to give and receive candid feedback, without being a jerk with no humanity.

I came across a short, yet powerful sentence there.

> You don’t fall down; you fall up'.

I started thinking...
1. Instead of play win-lose game, I can play win-win game.
1. Either I succeed at something, or I learn from the failure. 
1. With this approach, I win either way. The only condition is, I don't give up when I don't succeed, but analyze and find the core of the fall down.


Best,
Olek
